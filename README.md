| ------- | ----------- |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) | JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/) |
| [Express](https://expressjs.com/) | Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for creating [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). |
| [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) | A [strongly typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing) programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. |
| [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) | [Statically analyzes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) your code to quickly find problems. |
| [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) | A delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity. |
| [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) | Package software into standardized units for development, shipment and deployment |

## üßë‚Äçüè´ About

Node-TypeScript-Express-Docker-Starter is a template repo for building a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). This template contains a minimal [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration to enforce coding styles, and comes equipped with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit and integration testing. Additionally, this project's API routes are structured similarly to how components are organized in an [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/file-structure) project. Controllers are grouped by the API resource they serve, and the associated unit (spec.ts) and integration (e2e.ts) files live in the same directory.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Click the green [Use this template](https://github.com/bobbyg603/express-typescript-starter/generate) button to copy this repo to your GitHub account. Once you've copied the repo, clone it to your workspace (be sure to replace my URL with the URL to the repo you generated by clicking `Use this template`):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bobbyg603/node-typescript-express-docker-starter
```

Install the project's dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

Run the unit and integration tests to ensure everything installed correctly:

```sh
npm test && npm run e2e
```

The VS Code Debugger can be attached to a Node.js instance running on your local machine:

// todo bg picture

The VS Code Debugger can also be attached to a Node.js instance running inside a Docker container:

// todo bg picture

If you'd like start the development server without attaching the debugger:

```sh
npm start
```

If you'd like to automatically update the development sever when source files are changed you can can run the watch command:

```sh
npm run watch
```

The development server should begin listening for web requests. If you navigate to https://localhost:3000 in your browser you should see something that resembles the following:

// todo bg image
